This is a continuation of my osTicket Azure project. If you have not completed [osTicket-Post-Installation Configuration](https://github.com/GGeeto/osticket-Post-Installation-Configuration), ensure to do so before proceeding.

Navigate to the osTicket Support Center and select [osTicket Support Center](http://localhost/osTicket/). Enter the contact details of a user previously established in the last project. Within the osTicket Support Center, users are prompted to select a help topic; choose 'business critical outage' as previously configured. In the issue summary field, illustrate a scenario resembling a business critical outage, such as "Internet connection lost throughout all departments" or "Entire mobile banking website down." Elaborate on the details, crafting a scenario based on the chosen issue, and proceed by clicking 'Create Ticket.' We'll repeat this process to generate two additional tickets, utilizing our other fabricated help topics. For the second ticket, utilize the contact information of the other user created, and for the third, either reuse one of the existing users or navigate to the agents panel on the staff page to create another.
